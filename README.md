- Heya I'm Nishikiyama better known as Asuna in most communities. I am a part time developer and student. 
- I do some commissions for free, for example if they are way below what I'd call average I will most likely do them for free, but if they are above a skill group I will ask for a commission
- Former owner of Prison Servers on Plutonium T6.
